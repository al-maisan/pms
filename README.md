## Top priorities
 1. Vision
 1. Team
 1. Culture

### Vision

### Team
 1. Who is on the team?
 1. Why were they chosen?
 1. What skill / value do they contribute?
 1. Are they in an operative / advisory role?
 1. Diversity of backgrounds, skills and experience?
 1. How are the advisors interacting with the operatives?

### Culture
 1. Responsibility / authority
 1. How do we make decisions? 
 1. How do we resolve conflicts and disputes?
 1. On what basis do we determine what is important and set priorities?

## What has happened so far?
 1. What decisions have been taken?
 1. What promises have been made?
 1. On what grounds?
 1. Which of these impact the technical side of the business?

## Technology and engineering

### Culture

 1. business & technology are equal partners
 1. BIG money rides on top of our products / services - think security from the get-go (anti-patterns: Microsoft & FB)!
 1. lean to the engineering side (compromise between time, cost and features, no perfectionism)
 1. data driven, no bullshit; don't delay bad news.
 1. don't fall for your own (or anyone else's hype, [example](https://cointelegraph.com/news/we-dont-need-blockchain-r3-consortium-after-59-million-research)). Do what needs done.
 1. If you don't know what you are doing, say it, then carry out cheap(!) experiments and learn that way.
 1. question business requirements (especially the expensive ones!) and feed back what is possible and/or reasonable
 1. be incremental and iterative, always experiment!
 1. if you screw up something, fess up and clean up without delay
 1. lean toward high-quality where possible and appropriate

### Strategy 

 1. What are the major goals and priorities of the business?
 1. What kind of business do we aspire to become?
    1. high-tech? with important / foundational technology developed in-house?
    1. integrator? where we assemble existing solutions and integrate / repackage them in a product / service offering
    1. a combination of the two? If so, how are these aspects balanced / determined? What are the drivers?
    1. Will we operate our own products? Or license them to 3rd parties? Or both? What are the requirements arising from this?
 1. Nothing is forever, make decisions / choices that are good for N months and have a plan how to move forward once these "expire"

### Security

#### Requirements
 1. What needs to be secure to what degree
 1. 
#### The nitty-gritty

 1. do a first threat model / risk analysis pass
 1. educate people on [opsec](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/opsec-everyone-not-just-people-something-hide/) (particularly the business types)
 1. secure **all** accounts with 2FA ([trezor](https://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/u2f.html), [yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-neo/))
 1. internal artefact classification system (public / confidential / secret); how are artefacts secured?
 1. Facilitate access on a "need to know basis"; how do we make sure the right people have appropriate access?
 1. select the tools / providers for
    1. email (protonmail?)
    1. collaboration ([GSuite](https://gsuite.google.com/together/?user-benefits_activeEl=tab-connect)?, [wiki](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), kanban board, scrum)
    1. messaging (signal / wire.com?)
 1. migrate away from windows, lock down laptops / phones

### Technology selection

 1. define selection criteria up-front and in writing (what is important and what are we looking for?)
 1. lean to the open source
 1. pick tech backed by strong teams
 1. ignore bullshit and hype
 1. try the tech, build prototypes
 1. document the candidates and why something was chosen in the end

### Team

 1. concentric rings of people/teams according to their strategic relevance to the business, keep important talent close
 1. contract -> hire if at all possible, do not hire in high-bureaucracy/burden countries
 1. Both SG and CH are small / shallow engineering talent markets, identify and build a near-shore tech team/centre (Eastern Europe!)
